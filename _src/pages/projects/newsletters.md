Previous newsletters for the NCCPT, resembling a traditional magazine, was a PDF hosted on a third party website. the link then would be sent out via email to our email lists, which then asked the users to flip through a virtual magazine so they can read an article that they could not be read on a mobile device. The open rates of the email where below 1%, the click through rate was also below 1%, resulting in about 110 unique visitors a month for the magazine version of the newsletter. While knowing that the demographic is mainly using smartphones to open and read email, a magazine styled newsletter was not leading to any measurable conversion. 

My reaction was to create the email version that would include exerpts which would lead to the NCCPT blog. With the first Email newsletter had a 8% open rate and a 1.8% click through rate, and 98% of click traffic going to the NCCPT blog. This increase in traffic convinced the CEO and CFO to abandon the magazine style newsletter in favor of the Email.
