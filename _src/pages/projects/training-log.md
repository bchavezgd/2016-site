> “The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.”

I was asked to create this Daily Training and Nutrition Journal for the NCCPT based on an older designed. The previous version could not be folded over due to an inappropriate binding.  

I improved the design by using smaller type allowing more room for handwriting that's less than perfect. Switching to a wire binding allowed the journal to be folded completely over for easier handling while in a gym setting.

The final product will be helpful to personal trainers, and people who just need a way to record progress in the gym.
